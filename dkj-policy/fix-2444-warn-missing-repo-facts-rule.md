### PLAN

Inbound #2444: a consumer cut its `CLAUDE.md` down to imports, and nothing reported that no unscoped
rule held its facts. Verified on pickup: the symptom stands, because `check-consumer-prose.ps1` judged
only the import line and the root prose. The reason holds too. The mechanism the repair needs already
exists: `Get-AlwaysOnDocuments` tags every unscoped rule with `ImportedBy = '.claude/rules'`. Scope is
the warning. The optional adopt-step scaffold the report floated is left out.

### CREATE

- [x] `Test-UnscopedRulePresent` in `consumer-check-lib.ps1`, which reads the walk's own rows
- [x] A third `[WARNING]` in `check-consumer-prose.ps1`. It fires only where the root is imports-only
  and has no unscoped rule, and it never moves the exit code
- [x] Both files mirrored into `plugins/dkj-policy/scripts/`

### TEST

- [x] `consumer-prose-gate.tests.ps1`: 129/129. The new asserts cover four cases. With no rule the
  check warns. With an unscoped rule it stays silent. With only a `paths:`-scoped rule it still warns.
  A root that carries prose gets only the prose warning. The hook forwards the new warning
- [x] The lint and test gate via open-pr

### DEPLOY: fix/2444-warn-missing-repo-facts-rule

A consumer whose root `CLAUDE.md` is imports-only now hears about it at session start when no unscoped
`.claude/rules/*.md` exists. `consumer-prose-sessioncheck` prints a `[WARNING]` saying the repo's
trunk, visibility, owner and purpose are stated nowhere a session loads, and where to put them. A
`paths:`-scoped rule does not silence it, because that rule is gone on every turn that does not touch
its files. The finding the report measured was made by hand, and this makes it automatic.

Tier 0 is scored for a session in a consumer that has just done the #2374 cut. It closes the one gap
the cut's own checks could not see.

**Score:** 3

#### What makes this deploy extra special

N/A. It is an advisory session check and nothing reaches a subscriber.

**Score:** N/A
