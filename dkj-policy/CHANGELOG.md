### DEPLOY: feat/sessioncheck-remote-staleness · 20261001-092720Z

A new `dkj-policy` SessionStart hook, `release-freshness-sessioncheck`, warns the user visibly when
GitHub carries a newer release of the dkj plugins than the one the session is running. It names both
versions and the `update-plugins` skill. Until now nothing did: `connector-sessioncheck` compares against
the local marketplace clone, which only moves on `claude plugin marketplace update`, and every
session-start hook printed plain text that reaches the model but never the user. The new hook compares
release tags rather than commits, so work merged between releases does not trigger it. It is silent
when the session is current, offline or unable to check. The network probe runs once per session and is
bounded at five seconds.

#### What makes this deploy extra special

A consumer who falls behind a release now sees a warning in the terminal at session start, telling them
to run `/dkj-policy:update-plugins`. Before this they had to guess. A current session costs about one
`git ls-remote` per session start and shows nothing.
