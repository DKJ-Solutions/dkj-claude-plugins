### DEPLOY: feat/ship-pr-early-forward-lap · 20261023-145306Z

When the trunk gains a commit while a PR's CI is still running, `ship-pr` now brings the branch up to
date at once and waits for the fresh run, instead of first sitting out a run whose certificate step 3b
was always going to refuse. The gate is unchanged: the same staleness predicate, the same fold discount
and the same `-MaxForwardLaps` budget, which the early forward shares. Anything the early phase cannot
read hands over to the existing wait, so its worst case is the old behaviour. On PR #3348 this would
have saved about 8 of 19 minutes.

**Score:** 3

#### What makes this deploy extra special

A consumer running `ship-pr` on a busy trunk gets its pull request merged one CI run sooner whenever
another merge lands during its CI wait. Nothing to configure, and `-MaxForwardLaps 0` still switches
every lap off.

**Score:** 3

#### Pull Request

ship-pr laps forward as soon as the trunk moves during the CI wait, instead of after the stale run finishes
