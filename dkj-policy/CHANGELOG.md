# Changelog

Everything merged since the last release sits under **`## [Unreleased]`**, **newest first**: **one `###` per
change**, and under it two named `####` sections. The `###` heading is the change's own —
`` DEPLOY: `<branch>` `` and the moment it
landed — and the text directly beneath it answers what a reader arrives with: what the change deploys to
`main`. Then `#### What makes this deploy extra special` for the second audience, and `#### Pull Request`.
Every level here moved one deeper on August 26, 2026, when the pending section above them was introduced and
the development cycle beside them shifted to match; entries written before that day carry the whole set one
level shallower and are read exactly as they always were.
The tier numbers live in the parser rather than in any heading. That second heading said `PR` rather than
`deploy` for one day, August 24 to 25, 2026, and `change` for the four days before that; every wording it
has ever carried is still read, so an entry below written under any of them is parsed exactly as it always
was — including the four written under `PR`, which are in the list below right now. Entries written
before August 23, 2026 carry that first answer under a `###` question of its own with the second nested
at `####` beneath it; entries before August 16 carry the longer set of headings that shape replaced, and
every earlier shape is read exactly as it always was. Every release ever cut is listed in
[`releases/history.md`](releases/history.md) — each with its date, type and title, and a link to what that
release was worth. How the mechanism works (entry files, the Significance sections, folding) is described in
[`dkj-policy/CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Each change declares its own **reach**, and per audience how much it **weighs** there — one `##### Tier N`
sub-section per tier where a repo writes them numbered, each closing with its score; here the audience tier
carries a named heading beside the others instead. This list does not order on it: it is a record of what
landed, so it reads in the order things landed. What the declaration decides is what the **release
documents** lead with — they rank themselves on it — and what may be released at all, because **the bump
follows the highest tier pending**: **tier 0 only earns a patch**, **tier 1 or higher earns a minor**, and
a **major** recaps ten minors. So a changelog holding nothing but tier 0 is a patch waiting to be cut, not
a release with nobody to announce it to.

**The line directly under `## [Unreleased]` is a tally, and nobody types it.** It reads
`**4 / 9 minor entries**`: how many of the pending entries reach the audience this repo publishes to, out of
how many are waiting for the next release, and which bump that work has earned. The two numbers answer
different questions and may differ — the fraction counts tier 2 and above, the bump follows tier 1 and
above — so `**0 / 8 minor entries**` says nothing reaches a subscriber while the version still owes a minor
for what reaches management. It is
**derived from the entries below it every time it is written**, by the fold that adds one and the cut that
removes them all, so it holds no state of its own and a hand-edited count is simply corrected on the next
fold. It ends with an HTML comment that marks it as machine-written; that marker is what the next run
replaces, so anything else written in this space is left alone.

## [Unreleased]

**1 / 1 minor entry** <!-- pending-tally -->

### DEPLOY: feat/2100-bwj-cycle-extensions · 20260918-081829

`dkj-policy-bwj` now states what installing it does to `dkj-policy`'s cycle, and it is exactly two steps
with nothing before the step list touched. **The last step under `### CREATE` is always
`Is the change visible in the frontend / storefront?`** -- dropped with its reason where nothing renders,
and otherwise a preview theme, a comment on the GitHub issue carrying the steps and every URL, and
`- [x]` only once a **person** confirms they looked. Being last is the enforcement: `dkj-policy`'s own
step-list gate refuses the push and the merge while it is open, so an unconfirmed preview stands between
the work and the PR -- and an agent may never tick it itself, because it can prove a theme exists and
never that somebody looked at it. **And just before the issue closes, the paste-ready block gains its
go-live half**: the next release day, the version that release is on course for, and the live storefront
URL per market, written by the new `build-golive-block.ps1` behind the `golive-block` skill.

Neither half became a fifth chapter. Each landed in the chapter whose subject it already is -- previews,
and ticket handling -- so no chapter count, README table or structure assert moved; the plugin README
carries an index instead, which is the one thing neither chapter answers on its own. `PREVIEW-portable.md`
also loses half of a "what this page does not decide" bullet that stopped being true: it disclaimed the
trigger as well as the judgement, which left the trigger to memory.

Three things the mechanism deliberately will not do, all measured as the expensive direction elsewhere in
this workflow. It **never writes `[ADD LINK]`** -- that placeholder is CI's, which cannot know the link,
and a session can, so a link it was not given is a sentence it does not write. It **never promises**:
*"Planned to go live"*, because a tier-1 entry landing on the Friday turns a predicted patch into a minor,
and this block is the one surface a colleague quotes back. And it **guesses nothing** -- no `v*` tag or an
unreadable pending tally means no version in the sentence, and a repo with no declared markets gets no URL
list. The version is read off the tally the fold already writes rather than re-derived, because the tier
parser lives in `dkj-policy`'s libs and this plugin's scripts may not reach a second plugin's folder.

**Score:** 3

#### What makes this deploy extra special

For the two BWJ store repos this changes the working day: every branch now ends its CREATE list with a
question that holds the PR until a person has actually looked at the preview, and every ticket a colleague
filed now comes back with a date, a version and a live link instead of only *"it is done"*. Both are
things they had to remember before, and the first is now held by a gate rather than by memory. The source
repo gets the second half only, and there the URL list is simply empty -- it declares no markets.

**Score:** 4

#### Pull Request

The two cycle steps dkj-policy-bwj adds: the storefront-visibility step under CREATE, and the go-live half of the paste-ready block
