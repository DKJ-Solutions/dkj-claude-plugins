### DEPLOY: fix/2555-unanswered-decide-seams · 20260927-230034Z

`check-script-contract` now tells an unanswered `decide` seam apart from a harmless optional one. A `decide` seam states what the repo IS, so its fallback is an answer nobody chose; until now it printed the same `[INFO]` as a `copy` seam, and the session check called the repo `in sync`. It now adds one non-counting `[UNANSWERED]` line naming every such seam, and the session check forwards it in place of the in-sync verdict. Exit codes and tallies are unchanged. This repo now states the four `decide` seams it used to leave undefined on purpose, each returning its fallback, so a considered answer can be told from an unasked one here too ([#2555](https://github.com/DKJ-Solutions/dkj-claude-plugins/issues/2555)).

#### What makes this deploy extra special

A repo on this workflow now sees, at session start, the questions only it can answer that it never has -- named in one line, such as `Get-ReleaseAudienceTier`, whose silence costs every changelog entry two empty tier sections. Answering each one, with any value including the fallback, clears the line.

#### Pull Request

check-script-contract: report unanswered 'decide' seams as their own class, and stop the session check calling that state in sync
