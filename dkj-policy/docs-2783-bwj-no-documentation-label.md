> **How this file is read.** A step is `- [ ]` until it is resolved -- `- [x]` done, or
> `- [~]` dropped with the reason, which exists so nobody ticks a box for work they did not do.
> open-pr and ship-pr both refuse while one is still open, and there is no `-Force`.
>
> **FOUR `###` HEADINGS, AND NEVER A FIFTH** -- PLAN, CREATE, TEST, DEPLOY are the whole top
> level. A section needing its own heading goes in as a `####` UNDER whichever of the four owns
> it. No gate in YOUR repo reads a heading, so this half is on you -- only the repo that authors
> this workflow refuses a fifth (Dave, August 26, 2026).
>
> **AND NOTHING BRANCH-SPECIFIC ABOVE THE FIRST OF THOSE FOUR HEADINGS** -- everything between the
> title and it is this guidance, which is identical in every branch document. A status line, a note about
> THIS branch or an instruction to a session belongs under one of the four, normally as a `####`
> in PLAN. THIS half open-pr refuses, in every repo, before the push -- it reads the shape, so a
> guidance block in your own language passes and your own paragraph here does not (Dave,
> August 26, 2026; refused since #1650).
>
> **DEPLOY takes no steps of its own, and it is WRITTEN LAST** -- it is what the branch DID, once
> TEST says so. Written while steps above it are still open it states an INTENTION, and no gate
> holds it against what landed: the step gate splits this file at that heading and counts only
> above it. The PR title is the one exception -- new-branch -Title writes it at creation, because
> open-pr composes the PR title from it. It is the one part of this file that travels verbatim
> into `CHANGELOG.md` at the merge. In each tier, write the reason
> ABOVE the Score line -- anything below it is discarded.
>
> Relative links in that text resolve FROM THIS DIRECTORY -- `CHANGELOG.md` sits here too, so
> write each path exactly as it reads in this file.
>
> For tier 2 audiences: the user who relies on what this repo ships, and decides whether to take the next version -- a subscriber of a service, or the user of a tool, its own maintainer included. That reader and nobody else -- what matters only
> inside this repo belongs under the first `**Score:**`. If the change reaches that reader
> not at all, N/A is a complete answer and the common one. **One hop and no further:** where that
> reader is itself a business, ITS own customers sit one hop past this repo and are never the reader
> here -- they take nothing this repo ships. Name the party that runs the upgrade, and score
> against them.
>
> The phase arc, the marks and the whole form: `DEVELOPMENT-portable.md`, which ships
> with this workflow.

### PLAN

Dave on #2783: an issue is always a `feature` (something new) or a `bug` (something existing that
changes); the `documentation` label stops. Scope is the BWJ plugin, where the store repos get the label.

### CREATE

- [x] `WORKFLOW-portable.md`, `report-issue` and the README: the kind is always one of two, no third
  kind, no `documentation` row; the `Github Type` paragraph keeps `Task` for older issues only
- [x] `adopt-dkj-policy-bwj` step 4: no check or create for `documentation`, a cleanup for open issues
  still on it, and the `docs` prefix row answers `$null`

### TEST

- [x] `dkj-policy-bwj.tests.ps1`: three asserts pin the retirement; 550 of 550 pass

### DEPLOY: docs/2783-bwj-no-documentation-label

In a BWJ store repo every issue is now filed as either a `feature` (something new being added) or a
`bug` (something that exists and has to change), doc findings included. There is no third kind any
more, and the `documentation` label is no longer set or created. The adoption skill (step 4) shows how
to give the open issues still carrying `documentation` their kind and take it off, and a `docs/` pull
request goes out without a label
([#2783](https://github.com/DKJ-Solutions/dkj-claude-plugins/issues/2783)).
